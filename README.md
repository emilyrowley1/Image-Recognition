# Overview

I decided to create this software because I wanted to learn more about machine learning and more specifically how to get a computer to recognize an image.

The software I wrote is not done. Right now I have sections in this program. The first section determines what an image is based on a pre-learned set. The second section can identify things in a video.

# Development Environment

I used the python language to write my code and Visual Studio Code as my development environment. The image recognition and training software is all part of the imageai library. I installed this library using the anaconda software.

# Future Work

* Fully committed to github repo
* Image recognition more accurate
* Learn how to train the AI
* Teach it to count occurrences
